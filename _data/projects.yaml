  subtitle: Reduction of the Impact of untreated Waste Water on the Environment in case of torrential Rain

  description: The consequences of climate change have become visible in heavy rainfall events. During heavy rainfall, polluted wastewater enters the natural environment and leads to an increase in the concentration of pollutants in groundwater and rivers. In the RIWWER project, with funding from the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate, we are developing machine learning methods that use weather data and sensor data from the wastewater system to improve control of the wastewater system. The aim is to minimize the amount of pollutants that run off into groundwater and surface water.

  description: In a future were synthetic digital media are indistinguishable from real data, issues of data authentication in monitoring and verification deserve systematic analysis. In this project we investigate the risks and potential of synthetic satellite imagery for citizen-based monitoring.
