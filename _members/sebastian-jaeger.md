After studying computer science and data science, Sebastian J채ger has been working as a PhD student in the [Cognitive Algorithms Lab](https://calgo-lab.de) at the [Berlin University of Applied Sciences](https://www.bht-berlin.de/en/) since 2020. His research work mainly focuses on the development of ML methods and applications with an emphasis on automation for data quality. To accelerate the transfer of research innovations in ML to healthcare applications, two BMBF-funded research projects focus on machine learning for care, in particular on the value and risks of synthetic data with the prediction of fall risks as a use case.
